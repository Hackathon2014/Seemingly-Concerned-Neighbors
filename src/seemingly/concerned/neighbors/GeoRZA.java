 * This software is written for use in the GeoRZA android application.
 * GeoRZA is a tool for geophysicists to better understand the vertical and
 * horizontal seismic resolutions, with uncertainties, based off acquisition
 * parameters. The tool also allows users to use these uncertainties as 
 * constraints for a gravity inversion that inverts for the depth of top and
 * bottom of a layer in the subsurface.
