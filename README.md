Hackathon 2014

This is the app version of GeoRZA that was fully developed at the Hackathon 2014 in Denver, CO.
The development team consisted of: Brent Putman, Elias Arias, Gabe Martinez, and Thomas Rapstine.

To get the app, navigate to Hackathon14/bin and download and install "Hackathon14.apk" to your Android device. The app will appear amongst your other apps. Feel free to download and distribute as desired.

The user can interactively alter the following parameters of a seismic survey:

1. Depth to top of layer
2. Layer thickness
3. Peak frequency of wavelet
4. Maximum measurement offset

The app gives an estimate on the bounds of a target seismic layer. The estimate is based on Dix equations, assuming straight ray paths, a constant velocity model, no attenuation, and a 1D boxcar wavelet.
